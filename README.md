## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to better use the Flexbox layout and how to implement responsive text without a media query.

```scss
@mixin text-preset-1 {
  font: clamp(20px, 4vw, 24px)/150% "Figtree Extra Bold", sans-serif;
  letter-spacing: 0;
  color: $gray-950;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I hope to develop my SASS skills further.
